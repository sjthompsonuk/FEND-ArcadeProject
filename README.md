## Game Play

### Movement

* The player can move in all directions while remaining on the board.
* The player is allowed to move back down the board, including to the grass.
* Once across the road, the player will automatically reposition to the start.

### Enemies

* 3 Enemies automatically spawn. They vary their speed and lane randomly.
* Enemies will remain on the road squares, staying in their lane.
* A collision with an enemy reduces lives or causes a GameOver if no lives left.
* If the player keeps crossing, eventually the enemies speed up.

### Gems

* As the game progresses, gems may appear at random on the road.
* Collecting gems gains extra points.
* Gem colour does not affect gem value.

### Rocks

* As the game progresses, rocks may appear at random on the road.
* If a player hits a rock, a life will be lost, or GameOver if no lives left.
* If a player hits the rock and has lives available, the rock will be removed.
* A player might tactically use a life up to remove a particularly awkward rock.

### Hearts/Lives

* The player starts with 0 spare lives.
* Occasionally a heart will appear. If the player collects it they gain a life.
* A life is lost on colliding with either a rock or an enemy.
